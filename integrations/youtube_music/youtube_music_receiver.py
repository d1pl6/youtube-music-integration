"""
Flask-based HTTP receiver for YouTube Music URLs from the browser extension.

All Flask imports are **lazy** - they happen only when the receiver is
actually started (at most ~30 s per keybind press).

Security: the server is bound to 127.0.0.1 and issues a random per-run
token that the extension must echo back in an ``X-PM-Token`` header.
CORS is restricted to the YouTube Music origin, so an arbitrary webpage
cannot read the token or POST a URL.  (The token is browser-level
protection - any *local* process can read it the same way the extension
does; same-user local processes can already read the credential files,
so the threat model is unchanged.)

    127.0.0.1 only, so plain HTTP is acceptable.  The extension derives its
